This is actually not a realworld message, but a handwritten one. It is needed for test_realworld_authentication_results() to pass for buzon.

Unfortunately, we don't know if buzon.uy actually adds Authentication-Results for emails that come from other buzon.uy accounts. So, we don't know if Authentication-Results checking works with buzon.uy.
